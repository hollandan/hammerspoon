***** Please Note!  ************************************************************
* These are my personal settings
* They are not not well documented
* They rely on configs from:
   * ~/.hammerspoon/
   * ~/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json
   * ~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict
   * Better Touch Tool
   * And, probably a lot of other things, too
* DO NOT expect a direct copy and paste will work on your system
* DO expect a direct copy and paste will break your system
* Could I be doing something better? Let me know!
* See something useful? Free free to use it.
* Also: It is possible some code was stolen from other sources and not credited
   * If that's the case, sorry. Tell me; I'll do my best to credit appropriately
